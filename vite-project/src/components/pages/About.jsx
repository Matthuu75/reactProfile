            Hello! I'm John Doe, a passionate web developer based in [Your City]. I specialize in front-end and back-end development, creating responsive and user-friendly websites.
        </p>
        <p>
            With a strong foundation in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, I love turning ideas into reality. My goal is to build web applications that not only look great but also provide a seamless user experience.
        </p>
        <p>
            Outside of coding, I enjoy exploring new technologies, attending tech meetups, and staying up-to-date with the latest industry trends.
